          Gnd


As we know capacitor blocks any low frequency (ideally DC) passing through it. High frequency input signal is passed to gnd through capacitor.

By Circuit Analysis 
Vout = (Xc / Z ) * Vin
where, Xc is the Capacitive Reactance 
Xc = 1 / 2.pi.f.C , f = input signal frequency C = capacitance

Z is the total impendance 
Z = (R^2 + Xc^2)^(1/2) 

Bandwidth of simple RC filter Circuit is given by the formula 
Bd = 1/(2.pi.RC) , where wl = 0hz (DC)
                 , wh is given by the bd formula 

Circuit Parameter Calculation 
To build a low pass filter whose bandwith is 0 - 10Mhz 
R = Lets assume a resistance of 100kohm
To get bd = 5Mhz we will need capacitance of (10000000 * 2 * pi * 100000)^(-1) , i.e 0.159pF 





Layout capacitor
In skywater sky130 PDK there are two available mimcap  layout option , cap2m and capm. I have used the capm which is over the M3.The top layer of this capacitor is 
capm which is connected to metal4 through via3 and the bottom plate is metal3 which is connected to the metal1 through different via layers. Metal1 is grounded 
to decrease the bottom plate parasitic capacitance. The dielectric inside the capacitor is capild.

Capacitance 
Form the SkyWater SKY130 PDK we get Information about capm, mim cap areacapacitance as 2fF/um^2 and 0.19fF/um^2 periphery capacitance which is low compared to areacapacitance
capacitance. 

Layout Dimension 
1. Resistor 
    Here sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po is used whose resistance is 2k per 5.73um^2. To get 100kohm resistance we will use 5 fingers each of length 3.5um. 

2. capacitor
    We need capacitor of capacitance 2pf. Form earlier discussion about the capacitance of mimcap per um^2 we will need an cap of area 79.5 um^2 (8.91um * 8.91um)to get the
    required capacitance. 


NOTE: In the schmatic netlist I have added an parasitic capacitor (between vout and gnd i.e parallel to the original capacitor used)with name matching with that of layout netlist. It will not affect our circuit and netlist order. It 
is done purely to match device model and number during lvs testing. The parasitic capacitor is usually due to fringe capacitance or bottom plate Capacitance.

Also output wave form is provided in the Schematic Folder.
