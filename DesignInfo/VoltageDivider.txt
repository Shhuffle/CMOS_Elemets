Where all the resistance have equal resistance resulting in Vout = (4/5) * Vin 


Voltage Divider Layout Information 
To create the resistor I have used P+ poly precision resistor
From the https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/device-details.html#id86 we can get the sheet resistance of 5 different fixed widths plus a variable W/L option.

0.35 (0p35)
0.69 (0p69)
1.41 (1p41)
2.85 (2p83)
5.73 (5p73)

The fixed-width resistors are modeled using the equation.

I have used P+ poly resistor of width 0.35um ,4 square whose nominal resistance value is 2054 ohm
Note that the absoulte value of resistance is not important for the Voltage Divider ckt as long as the ratio is fixed for different temperature 
and Voltage range

To make  match resistor pair as much as possible Common -Cenroid layout is used.

To increase the noise immunity guard rings are placed, which are basically p+ diffusion region connected to gnd. They route currents form the 
neighbouring ckt to the gnd through p+ diffusion and p substrate region. 


Also from the skywater-pdk documentaion , the acceptable input voltage is 0 to 5 volt with maximum allowed current density for polysilicon resistors of 500uA/um. 
Since the with used in this layout is 0.35uA the allowed current density will be 500 * 0.35 = 175uA/um. In other word the current shouldnt exceed above 175uA
In case more current is required we must increase the width.
