Where all the resistance have equal resistance resulting in Vout = (4/5) * Vin 


Voltage Divider Layout Information 
To create the resistor I have used P+ poly precision resistor
From the https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/device-details.html#id86 we can get the sheet resistance of 5 different fixed widths plus a variable W/L option.

0.35 (0p35)
0.69 (0p69)
1.41 (1p41)
2.85 (2p83)
5.73 (5p73)

The fixed-width resistors are modeled using the equation.

I have used p poly resistor of width 0.35um.
Note that the absoulte value of resistance is not important for the Voltage Divider ckt as long as the ratio of resistance is fixed for different temperature 
and Voltage range
In this layout I have used 5 squares of p poly res which total length is 1.75um (sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po_0p35) for each of the fingers which is 2.519kohm. In total there are 7 fingers. The leftmost and 
rightmost fingers are dummy resistor left floating.

To make  match resistor pair as much as possible Common -Cenroid layout is used.

To increase the noise immunity guard rings are placed, which are basically p+ diffusion region connected to gnd. They route currents form the 
neighbouring ckt to the gnd through p+ diffusion and p substrate region. 


Also from the skywater-pdk documentaion , the acceptable input voltage is 0 to 5 volt with maximum allowed current density for polysilicon resistors of 500uA/um. 
Since the with used in this layout is 0.35uA the allowed current density will be 500 * 0.35 = 175uA/um. In other word the current shouldnt exceed above 175uA
In case more current is required we must increase the width. 

ALso licons are placed at the end of each resistors which is responsible for connected to metal layer. 
polyresc is placed at the end of resistor of heigh 2.2um which is the minimum height for poly contact.

NOTE: You will see different model name in the netlist of the xschem where I have manually changed the model name form sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po_0p35 to sky130_fd_pr__res_xhigh_po_0p35
This was done to match the lvs. This will not affect connectivity setup in schmatic and layout.
